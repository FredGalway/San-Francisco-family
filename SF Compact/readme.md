Fonts used on Apple Watch OS. It was named **San Francisco** at first, before Apple introduced the proper [San Francisco](../SF%20Pro/) as we know today.
First announced in 2015, this is the font that Apple designed in-house after nearly 20 years.

This sans-serif typeface is the system font for watchOS, and includes a [rounded variant](../SF%20Compact%20Rounded/). It suits a wide range of content and is easily legible in a variety of contexts.
