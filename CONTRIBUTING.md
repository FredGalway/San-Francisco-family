## Issue reporting
As you can see, there is no *Issue* tab \*shrug\*. Rest assured, this project obtains original Apple fonts from various sources that are official, for example, iOS, macOS and the Apple website -- there's no way that those fonts are modified, faked or damaged.  
And since GitHub is not a place for asking support, disabling *Issue* tab can minimize potential issue spam.

## Pull request (PR)
Since this tab cannot be disabled so I'll just leave it there. But you can help - by finding new San Francisco family font from official sources, make a PR and upload the fonts there.

Here's how:  
1. From my [SF repository](https://github.com/windyboy1704/San-Francisco-family), click **Create new file**.

2. In *Name your file...* box, enter the new font (starts with **SF**), and add a slash **/** behind it. Now, you can name your file as you want (but I will reject inappropriate one, mind that), example: *empty.md*. This is a hack to create a folder on GitHub website. Then click **Commit new file** at the bottom.

3. Now you can drag and drop the fonts you obtained into the folder you've created. In *Add an optional extended description...* box at the bottom, specify the source(s) that you obtained the fonts from as detailed as possible (I will reject if you don't specify one). You need to wait for them to finish uploading before clicking **Commit new file**. It is just an extra measure so I can check whether those fonts are authenic or not -- and to create README.md for the new SF font.

4. Done! Now wait for my approval.
